Predicting House Prices with Linear Regression

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

The objective of this project is to build a predictive model using linear regression to estimate house prices based on various numerical features. Linear regression is a fundamental machine learning algorithm, and this project provides hands-on experience in developing, evaluating, and interpreting a predictive model.


ðŸš€ Key Concepts and Challenges
Data Collection
Obtain a dataset with numerical features and a target variable (house prices) for prediction.
Data Exploration and Cleaning
Explore the dataset to understand its structure, handle missing values, and ensure data quality.
Feature Selection
Identify relevant features that may contribute to the predictive model.
Model Training
Implement linear regression using a machine learning library (e.g., Scikit-Learn).
Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance on a separate test dataset using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.
Visualization
Create visualizations to illustrate the relationship between predicted and actual house prices.

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Objectives

Understand linear regression concepts.
Gain practical experience in implementing a predictive model.
Learn how to evaluate and interpret model performance.
Develop visualization techniques for regression analysis.
